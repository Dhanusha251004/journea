                        Seongsan Ilchulbong (성산일출봉), also called Sunrise Peak, is a volcano on eastern Jeju Island, in Seongsan-ri, Seogwipo, Jeju Province, South Korea. 
                        It is 182 meters high and has a volcanic crater at the top. Considered one of South Korea's most beautiful tourist sites, 
                        it is famed for being the easternmost mountain on Jeju, and thus the best spot on the island to see the first sunrise of the year.
                        Seongsan Ilchulbong is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, "Seongsan" means "fortress mountain"; the mountain is said to resemble a Korean fortress.
                        "Ilchulbong" means "sunrise peak". 
                        It is derived from a belief that the mountain is one of the best places to view the sunrise on Jeju Island.

                    <div class="description">
                        Namdaemun Market (남대문시장) Opened in 1964, Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in Korea with shops selling various goods.
                        All products are sold at affordable prices and the stores in this area also function as wholesale markets.
                        Countless shops and street stalls lined its alleys, selling a variety of clothes, glasses, kitchenware, toys, mountain gear,
                        fishing equipment, stationery, fine arts, accessories, hats, carpets, flowers, ginseng and imported goods.
                        The market was thus limited to mostly Korean customers and merchants for centuries. However, the character of the market began to change drastically when the Empire of Japan forcefully opened Korea in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876.

                        Gyeongbokgung, also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace, was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. 
                        Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, South Korea. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, 
                        Gyeongbokgung served as the home of the royal family and the seat of government.
                        Gyeongbokgung, located in north of Gwanghwamun Square, was built three years after the Joseon dynasty was founded and it served as its main palace.
                        With the mountain Bugaksan behind it and the Street of Six Ministries (today's Sejongno) outside Gwanghwamun Gate, the main entrance to the palace,
                        Gyeongbokgung was situated in the heart of the Korean capital city.
