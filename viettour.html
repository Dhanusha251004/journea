                          The Golden Bridge (Vietnamese:Cầu Vàng) is 150m long pedestrian bridge in the Bà Nà Hills resort, near Da Nang, Vietnam.

                          with Trần Quang Hùng as the bridge designer and Nguyen Quang Huu Tuan as design manager.
                          Construction began in July 2017 and completed in April 2018; the bridge opened in June 2018.
